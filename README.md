# What?
An electronic conference badge, of course! (That makes this a wearable right?)

If you're interested in keeping up to date with new versions, you can add your email here:

## Yes, but what does it do?
By default the device does pleasant RGB fades across its 48 RGB LEDs. It also sends a beacon in infrared every 30 seconds. They use any beacons received to synchronize a clock from which an animation is derived. The effect is that if one is alone, it plays random colors. If a group of them are together, they play the same rainbow water drop animation together.

For a little more information, last year's was [written up by Hackaday here](https://hackaday.com/2017/07/14/badge-from-diamond-age-comes-to-def-con/).

This is a partial rewrite of the work done for [DEFCON](https://defcon.org/) 25 ([here](https://github.com/borgel/sympetrum-v2)).

## Why is it a dragonfly?
If you haven't read Neal Stephenson's [_The Diamond Age: or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827.The_Diamond_Age), do that first. I'll wait.

If you have, there's a sequence around page 300 in which Miranda is first introduced to the possibility of using the drummers to find Nell. In this scene she attends a party in which the revellers wear colorful cloisonn√© dragonfly pins. As the party progresses they transition from random colorful flickering to some sort of synchrony, and Miranda notices the participants do the same. This is what I built.

A [_Sympetrum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympetrum) is a genus of Dragonfly.
